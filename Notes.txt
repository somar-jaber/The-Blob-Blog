- the file ".eleventy.js" in the root is the config file for 11ty.
- in the "_includes" folder lives the layouts.
- the _site folder where the output files go. 
- when you write links in "href" attribute for another pages do not write the extension(s) like "blog.html" just write "blog" because 11ty will add ".html" automatically. The same note for any files like .md files.
- use the absolute path when assigning the css files to not have problems later in files. Consider the root folder is the "src" folder. 
- the json file which has its own folder's name , works as a config file for the "Front Matters" section that is in every file within the same directory. Like the "articles.json" in "articles" folder.
- When you use "tags" each tag will group it in a collection. you can access this collection by writing the "collections.tag_name" , there is also a special attribute "coolections.all" which has all the collections. 
- 11ty has its own way to show time so you need to control it in the config file ".eleventy.js"
- if you have a subfolders in your "pages" or "articles" folder , use "eleventyConfig.addPassthroughCopy("./src/path/to/your/folder");" to include the subfolders content.
